## What does it do?

It creates an audio wave according to various parameters, displays it, plays it, and allows you to save it.

It demonstrates the basics of a digital synthesizer, creating tones of various timbres by adding harmonic overtones, shaping the volume envelope (attack, decay, sustain, release), and adding basic echo and vibrato effects.
